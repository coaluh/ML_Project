## Projects
Project 1 — Machine Learning Classifiers

Preprocessing, custom Perceptron/Adaline, sklearn Logistic Regression & SVM.

Validation predictions exported as required CSVs.

Includes Jupyter notebook, presentation, and results.

See Project1-ML-Classifiers/README.md
 for full details.

Project 2 — Placeholder Title

Will include description, scope, and deliverables once assigned.

Folder: Project2-<Name>/

Project 3 — Placeholder Title

Will include description, scope, and deliverables once assigned.

Folder: Project3-<Name>/

## How to Use

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-user>/DASC41103-Projects.git
cd DASC41103-Projects
```

Navigate into the project folder you want to run:
```
cd Project1-ML-Classifiers
```

Follow the instructions in that project’s README.md.

## Notes

Each project is self-contained: all notebooks, data inputs (if allowed), outputs, and presentation slides are inside its folder.

Environment setup for each project is listed in that project’s requirements.txt.

Top-level repo serves as the portfolio hub for all projects.
